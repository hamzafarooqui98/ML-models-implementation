# ML-models-implementation
The repo contains 2 jupyter notebook files which shows the implemtation of ML models on real-world datasets. 

- The file `CE802_P2_Notebook` contains the practical implementation of ML classification scenario to predict malignant disease exist or not. The notebook is created as a comparative study between different classification models. The classification is computed using Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbour classifier and Support Vector Machine. Preprocessing and cleaning of the data was applied before providing as an input to the models.

- The file `CE802_P3_Notebook` contains the practical implementation of ML regression based scenario. The data provided is of different diabetes patients used to predict the value of insulin dosage required for each. The notebook is created as a comparative study between different regression models. Preprocessing and cleaning of the data was applied before providing as an input to the models. The regression is computed using Decision Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor. 

- The datasets used are provided as csv files.
